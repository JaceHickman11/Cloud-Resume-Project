  <h2><u>Personal Projects</u></h2>
  <p>This website! Developed and deployed a personal website <a href="https://jacehickman.com">jacehickman.com</a> utilizing Amazon Web Services. The front and backend code that created this project can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/JaceHickman11">github.com/JaceHickman11</a></p>
  <p>This project was inspired by the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a></p>
 <ul>
    <li>S3 - Hosts the web files HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
    <li>Route 53 - DNS, route any http request to the https site. Purchased the domain with this service as well.</li>
    <li>CloudFront - Content delivery, it ensures web content is given to the user at the closest AWS edge location to them.</li>
    <li>API Gateway - API creation to access my Lambda function and DynamoDB table in AWS</li>
    <li>DyanmoDB - The website has a "Page Views" in the top left. The current count is stored in a simple table using this service</li> 
    <li>Lambda - Serverless computing platform. I host the lambda_function.py here. When the site is loaded, Javascript sends a POST request to the API which triggers the Lambda function. The function accesses my table in DynamoDB, increments the "Page Views:" count, and reports the updated value to the website.</li> 
    <li>DyanmoDB - The website has a "Page Views" in the top left. The current count is stored in a simple table using this service</li> 
    <li>DyanmoDB - The website has a "Page Views" in the top left. The current count is stored in a simple table using this service</li> 
    <li>DyanmoDB - The website has a "Page Views" in the top left. The current count is stored in a simple table using this service</li>
